[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SpencerPark/ijava-binder/master) (JupyterLab [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SpencerPark/ijava-binder/master?urlpath=lab))

A [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) compatible repository to try out the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) kernel through a browser. Depending on if the docker image is already built, spawning the notebook may take some time and so please be patient with it.

In the future this repository may be populated with more example notebooks but it mainly serves to meet the requirements for using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service to play around with the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava).

## Notebook authors

If you are writing Jupyter notebooks in Java and publishing them on GitHub you are more than welcome (and encouraged!) to take any scripts from here and add them to your repository so that visitors may try out your notebooks without any installation.
